      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to RYV, a platform designed to help users submit complaints and
        seek help from respective department. Our mission is to provide a safe
        and accessible platform for users to voice their concerns. Here citizens
        can raise their problems related to several government bodies.We would
        like to say that after the user who has been registered can then raise
        their complaint and wait for a time so that the particular department
        reacts for it. And the status of the given problem is being shown
        continuously.Here we are introducing a voting system to vote the
        problems and if the number of votes for a problem is more then that
        problem will be given first priority. And hence the problem is solved.
